      Welcome to my website! The more you explore, the more you'll learn about me and the skills I've honed throughout my adult life. Another purpose of this site is to reliably archive my work and projects on a platform where I have complete autonomy. I hope you enjoy your visit and find something interesting. If so, please feel free to reach out. I love meeting new people and hearing about their work.
