      <p class="about__paragraph">Hey, I’m glad you’re here.</p>

      <p class="about__paragraph">I’m a developer, problem-solver, and all-around curious human who loves building cool, useful things, mostly with Java, Spring Boot, and Angular. I’ve been in the software world for over five years now, and I still get a kick out of turning ideas into clean, working code that actually makes a difference.</p>
      
      <p class="about__paragraph">Lately, I’ve also been diving into the world of AI. I’m fascinated by how it's reshaping everything—from how we build software to how we think about creativity. I enjoy experimenting with new AI tools, exploring their potential (and limits), and finding ways to blend them into my projects to work smarter and create faster.</p>
      
      <p class="about__paragraph">By day, I design and build backend systems. By night (and sometimes on weekends), I dive into digital art and CGI—creating in Blender, sketching, and bringing visuals to life just for the fun of it. I like to think of my brain as split between logic and creativity—and honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
      
      <p class="about__paragraph">I started this portfolio to showcase what I’ve done, what I’m learning, and what I’m excited about next. If you’re into thoughtful design, solid code, AI experiments, or a bit of creative flair, you’ll probably feel right at home here.</p>
      
      <p class="about__paragraph">Let’s connect if you’re building something interesting, or just want to talk tech, art, or life.</p>
